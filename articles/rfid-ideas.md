### Ideas for RFID system

build out a simple admin webserver that can be managed locally, this will be the start of our api intergration. The simple solution would be to setup some admin users to it and apply that to an rfid login to the door so there is no login system that needs to be created.

this app should have a simple data store that we can cache users, and associate these users to the api, this interface could be a way to add in the associations as well.

this app can also serve as a debugging tool for the rfid system.

I think it could be cool to have this log all checkins to the space we can the intergrate that into the website, to have a smart way of checking if someone is in the space, eg. "Someone last checked in 4 minutes ago"
